The Police
----------

Every breath you take                              Every move you make
And every move you make                            And every vow you break
Every bond you break                               Every smile you fake
Every step you take                                Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you                               I'll be watching you

Every single day                                   Every move you make
And every word you say                             Every step you take
Every game you play                                I'll be watching you
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you                               I'll be watching you
                                                   (Every breath you take)
Oh, can't you see                                  (Every move you make)
You belong to me?                                  (Every bond you break)
How my poor heart aches                            (Every step you take)

                                                   (Every vow you break)
Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace  (Every smile you fake)
I dream at night, I can only see your face         (Every claim you stake)
I look around, but it's you I can't replace        I'll be watching you
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace        (Every single day)
I keep crying baby, baby please                    (Every word you say) Whoo, hoo
                                                   (Every game you play)
Oh, can't you see                                  (Every night you stay) I'll be watching you
You belong to me?                                  I'll be watching you
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take?
