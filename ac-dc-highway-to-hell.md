Livin' easy                          I'm on the highway to hell
Lovin' free                          Highway to hell
Season ticket on a one way ride      I'm on the highway to hell
Askin' nothin'                       Highway to hell
Leave me be
Takin' everythin' in my stride       Don't stop me
Don't need reason                    I'm on the highway to hell
Don't need rhyme                     On the highway to hell
Ain't nothin' that I'd rather do     I'm on the highway to hell
Goin' down                           On the highway to...
Party time                           (Highway to hell) I'm on the highway to hell
My friends are gonna be there too    (Highway to hell) highway to hell
                                     (Highway to hell) highway, highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell           (Highway to hell)
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell                      And I'm goin' down
I'm on the highway to hell           All the way
                                     I'm on the highway to hell
No stop signs
Speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
Gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey satan
Payin' my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey mumma
Look at me
I'm on the way to the promised land
