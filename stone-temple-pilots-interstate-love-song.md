Interstate Love Song
====================

Stone Temple Pilots
-------------------

Waiting
On a Sunday afternoon
For what I read between the lines
Your lies
Feelin'
Like a hand in rusted shame
So do you laugh or does it cry
Reply

Leavin'
On a southern train
Only yesterday
You lied
Promises
Of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time
Go by
All of these things you said to me

Breathing
Is the hardest thing to do
With all I've said
And all that's dead for you
You lied
Goodbye

Leavin'
On a southern train
Only yesterday
You lied
Promises
Of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time
Go by
All of these things I said to you
